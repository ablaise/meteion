Meteion
=======

Meteion is a straightforward PHP application that loads FFXIV client data into a relational database.

# Getting Started

First, you need to extract the FFXIV client using [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach).

You can simply extract the client in the language you are interested in using the following command.

```shell
./SaintCoinach.Cmd.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn" "lang English" rawexd
```

For more information, please refer to the [SaintCoinach documentation](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach#state-of-documentation).

# Installation

```shell
composer require ablaise/meteion
```

# Symfony Integration

Coming soon.
